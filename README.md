# chalk
## Simple, easy to learn interpreted programming language.
### Hello world in Chalk!
`write "Hello World!"`
### If statements
#### Bug: only the innermost statements blocks are executed!
```
animal = "Cat"
favorite_animal = "Cat"
if @animal == @favorite_animal then
  write "You like cats too huh?"
end if`
```
